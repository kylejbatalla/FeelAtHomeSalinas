    <p>Located in Northeast Salinas, Feel At Home Residential Facility has been
       family owned and operated for 15+ years. We provide high quality elderly care
       and living assitance for your loved ones where they will be treated with love, care, and respect. Unlike other larger assisted living
       facilities that house 100+ residents and caregiver to resident ratios can range anywhere from 1:5
       or 1:20, Feel At Home's small family oriented facility ensures that your loved ones will receieve
       the quality like 1:1 care that they deserve.
    <br><br>Our small, quiet, and comfortable facility has all the amenities to feel like home. With ambulatory and non-ambulatory care provided, as well as private and semi-private rooms available,
       we want you to feel comfortable knowing that your loved ones are accounted for and delicately
       cared for 24/7. Give them the home they deserve, make them feel at home! For a more in-depth perspective of our services provided, please navigate
       to the "<a href="services.html">Services</a>" page. For inquiries, pricing, and availability, please contact administrator Normita Batalla
     via the "<a href="contact.html">Contact Us</a>" page.</p>

      <p>"Caring for others will always be my priority.
      I love having the priviledge of expanding my 25+ years of nursing experience towards our elderly residents and their needs.
      That is the sole reason why I decided to open Feel At Home in 2004. I believe everybody, no matter what age, deserves
      a happy and healthy life. We would love to have your loved ones be apart of our loving and family oriented community!"</p>
